# Tournament Tree Simulation

This project implements a Tournament Tree using a custom data structure in C. It simulates a single-elimination tournament where participants are compared in pairs based on their skill levels, and the winner progresses to the next round until a final winner is determined.

## Features

- Supports dynamic input of player skill levels.
- Constructs a binary tree structure for tournament simulation.
- Displays each round of the tournament with matchups.
- Determines the final winner with the highest skill.

## Files

- `tournament_tree.c` – Main source code file.
- `Tournament_Tree_Report.docx` – Project report detailing the structure, algorithm, and usage.

## Compilation

To compile the program, use:

```bash
gcc tournament_tree.c -o tournament_tree
